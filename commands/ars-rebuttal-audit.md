description: ARS academic-paper `rebuttal-audit` mode — QA an existing rebuttal draft against reviewer comments
model: sonnet
---

First invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "academic-research-skills:academic-paper"`. Pass the mode and the user's request described below as its arguments. Use the loaded skill and its supporting files before producing the result.

Trigger the `academic-paper` skill in `rebuttal-audit` mode. Requires BOTH the reviewer comments AND an existing rebuttal/response draft to evaluate. Produces an advisory QA report (per-comment coverage + gaps + risk flags). Does NOT generate a new response, and does NOT emit Schema 11 / Material Passport / verified status (standalone invocation runs outside the pipeline). Fidelity spectrum, low oversight.

If only reviewer comments are present (no draft yet), use `revision-coach` instead.

Mode reference: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/MODE_REGISTRY.md` § academic-paper.
Skill entry: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/academic-paper/SKILL.md`.

Resolve plugin resources from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, not from the paper project's working directory. If the skill or a required file cannot be loaded, report the loading failure and stop; do not substitute this command summary for the mode instructions.
